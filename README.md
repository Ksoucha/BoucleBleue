## Game Overview
Text-based game made in C# with Visual Studio Console Application, in collaboration with [noemiealexia](https://github.com/noemiealexia). Throughout the game, the player is prompted to type in the console, either to indicate what object they want to inspect, what room they want to go to, or what action they want to do. The text options are between square brackets, and the player needs to write the word correctly for it to work. The core of the gameplay is a series of actions that the player needs to do in order to unlock other actions/options (system of dependencies). The player can also freely move from one room to another. The rooms' descriptions will slightly change depending on the actions that the player has unlocked, and the universe will become darker and stranger. After the player has triggered the end-game action, the game will end and the ending 1, 2 or 3 will be displayed.
